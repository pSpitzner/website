# Website Content from Markdown

Time to celebrate, this is my first content that uses the new format.

For a while I have been noticing that it feels too cumbersome to add content to this site;
writing is hard and it is harder when you do it in html.
Then there is _markdown_, which feels completely opposite.
It is convenient, easy to read and easy to write in _any_ editor. You can even write a paper with colleagues in real time, without ever leaving [your browser](https://demo.codimd.org/features?both).
Seriously, if you are not familiar with markdown yet, let me recommend spending a few minutes of procrastination to check it out.

Considering the goal to get markdown files onto my custom site, the only hurdle was to render the `.md` files to html.
First, I considered parsing only once before uploading everything so that page loads remain snappy.
Then I realized that parsing an average document takes less than 10ms and ended up using [Parsedown](https://github.com/erusev/parsedown), a renderer in php.
This allows me to simply drop the `.md` files into a folder on the server, php fetches them and parsedown creates the html for every file.

See this snippet of `php`:
```
foreach (glob("folder_with_markdown_files/*.md") as $file) {
    $html = Parsedown::instance()->text(file_get_contents($file));
    echo "<hr><div class='markdown'>";
    echo $html;
    echo "</div>";
}
```
