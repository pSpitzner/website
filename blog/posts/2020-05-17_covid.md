# COVID-19 Inference and Forecast

How effective are interventions?

Our paper about estimating the effects of governmental interventions on the spread of COVID-19 is now out in Science!

Over the past months, my colleagues and I have worked on modeling the COVID-19 spread in Germany.
Our approach uses Bayesian inference and Markov-Chain Monte-Carlo sampling on an SIR-model to find epidemiological parameters.
It allows us to identify change points in the spreading rate (that is, _when_ and _how much_ the spreading rate changes). Check the links below for all the details!

I want to take the opportunity to thank everyone involved for this amazing collaboration. This has been, and still is, a truly great team effort. I feel that we have made a valuable contribution, and for me personally, the project made quarantine and working from home much more enjoyable! Thanks guys!
